# Gate-Wize

CONTEXT AND CHALLENGES As part of the project validation process (PGC), project managers must complete a form detailing their initiative (objectives, motivations, functional and non-functional requirements, users, etc.). Currently, the quality of responses is often insufficient, leading to:
Numerous back-and-forths between project managers and the architecture team.
A significant loss of time in the validation cycle.
A risk of misunderstanding business requirements. The challenge is therefore to improve the quality and completeness of the dossiers while reducing validation times.
PROPOSED SOLUTION We propose an intelligent web application based on generative AI (GenAI), which assists project managers in entering and improving the quality of their Gate form.
Key features
Intelligent assistance: real-time analysis of entered responses.
Automated scoring: per-field score and overall completeness score.
Explanations & suggestions: identification of missing elements and proposed additions.
Exportable report: dossier ready to be submitted to the architecture team.
Jira integration: automatic link to project management and traceability of requests.
Integration with the SSO
Immediate benefits
Clearer, standardized dossiers.
Drastic reduction in iterative exchanges.
Time savings for both parties (project managers and architects).
