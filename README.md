Context and Challenges

As part of the project validation process (PGC), project managers must complete a form describing their initiative (objectives, motivations, functional and non-functional requirements, users, etc.).

However, the quality of the submitted answers is often insufficient, leading to:
	•	Numerous back-and-forths between project managers and the architecture team
	•	Significant loss of time in the validation cycle
	•	Risks of misunderstanding business requirements

The challenge is therefore to improve the quality and completeness of the dossiers while reducing validation time.

Proposed Solution

We propose an intelligent web application based on generative AI (GenAI) that assists project managers in completing and improving the quality of their Gate form.

Key Features
	•	Intelligent assistance: real-time analysis of the responses entered
	•	Automated scoring: per-field score + overall completeness score
	•	Explanations & suggestions: identification of missing elements and proposed enhancements
	•	Exportable report: dossier ready to be submitted to the architecture team
	•	Jira integration: automatic linking to project management and traceability
	•	SSO integration for immediate and secure access

Immediate Benefits
	•	Clearer, standardized dossiers
	•	Drastic reduction in iterative exchanges
	•	Significant time savings for both project managers and architects
